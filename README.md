# My-First-Website
My first website created a few months, it was actually to prank friends back in school so it was a Rick roll gif embed using an audio player
Since chrome doesn't allow automatic audio plays I had to embed an audio player. But here I changed the text in the website to suit the context but the audio and gif was kept the same.
It was created using basic html and css.
